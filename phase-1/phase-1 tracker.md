* [ ] Why both must be overridden together
* [ ] Coding: Custom class with proper equals/hashCode

---

### ✅ Day 3 (Wed)

* [ ] String intern pool
* [ ] Immutability concept
* [ ] Why String is immutable (security + performance)
* [ ] Coding: String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

---

### ✅ Day 4 (Thu)

* [ ] HashMap internal structure
* [ ] Bucket, hash, collision
* [ ] Load factor & resizing
* [ ] Coding: simulate collisions

---

### ✅ Day 5 (Fri)

* [ ] HashMap in Java 8 (treeification concept)
* [ ] LinkedHashMap vs HashMap
* [ ] When ordering matters
* [ ] Quick revision of Week topics

---

### 🧠 Day 6 (Sat) — Light Day

* [ ] Revise all concepts (no new topics)
* [ ] Write short notes:

  * HashMap flow
  * equals/hashCode rules

---

### 🔥 Day 7 (Sun) — Deep Work

* [ ] Build **Mini HashMap (basic version)**
* [ ] Handle:

  * put()
  * get()
  * simple collision handling (list)
* [ ] Debug using logs
* [ ] Self-evaluation:

  * Can explain HashMap without notes?

---

# 📅 Week 2: Multithreading & Concurrency

---

### ✅ Day 8 (Mon)

* [ ] What is a thread?
* [ ] Thread lifecycle
* [ ] Creating threads (Runnable vs Thread)
* [ ] Coding: basic thread program

---

### ✅ Day 9 (Tue)

* [ ] Race conditions
* [ ] Critical section
* [ ] `synchronized` keyword
* [ ] Coding: unsafe vs safe counter

---

### ✅ Day 10 (Wed)

* [ ] `volatile` keyword
* [ ] Visibility vs atomicity
* [ ] Happens-before concept (basic understanding)
* [ ] Example coding

---

### ✅ Day 11 (Thu)

* [ ] `ReentrantLock`
* [ ] Difference vs `synchronized`
* [ ] Deadlock basics
* [ ] Coding: lock-based solution

---

### ✅ Day 12 (Fri)

* [ ] ExecutorService
* [ ] Thread pools (fixed, cached)
* [ ] Why thread pools are used
* [ ] Coding: executor example

---

### 🧠 Day 13 (Sat) — Light Day

* [ ] Revise:

  * synchronized vs Lock
  * volatile vs synchronized
* [ ] Write comparison notes

---

### 🔥 Day 14 (Sun) — Deep Work

* [ ] Build:

  * Producer–Consumer problem
  * Thread-safe counter (3 approaches)
* [ ] Identify:

  * race condition points
* [ ] Self-evaluation:

  * Explain concurrency issues confidently

---

# 📅 Week 3: JVM & Performance Basics

---

### ✅ Day 15 (Mon)

* [ ] JVM architecture (Heap, Stack, Method Area)
* [ ] Class loading overview
* [ ] Execution engine basics

---

### ✅ Day 16 (Tue)

* [ ] Garbage Collection basics
* [ ] Minor vs Major GC
* [ ] G1 GC overview
* [ ] When GC runs

---

### ✅ Day 17 (Wed)

* [ ] Memory leaks in Java (yes, they exist)
* [ ] Common causes:

  * static references
  * collections
* [ ] Coding example

---

### ✅ Day 18 (Thu)

* [ ] OutOfMemoryError vs StackOverflowError
* [ ] Heap dump concept
* [ ] Basic debugging mindset

---

### ✅ Day 19 (Fri)

* [ ] JVM tuning basics
* [ ] Common flags:

  * `-Xms`, `-Xmx`
* [ ] GC logging awareness
* [ ] Quick revision

---

### 🧠 Day 20 (Sat) — Light Day

* [ ] Revise:

  * GC flow
  * JVM structure
* [ ] Write:

  * “How Java manages memory” (in your own words)

---

### 🔥 Day 21 (Sun) — Deep Work + Evaluation

#### 🛠 Practical

* [ ] Simulate memory issue (large list, static leak)
* [ ] Observe behavior

#### 🎯 Evaluation (VERY IMPORTANT)

* [ ] Answer aloud:

  * Why HashMap is not thread-safe?
  * How GC works?
  * What causes memory leaks?
* [ ] Record yourself (optional but powerful)

---

# 🧠 Final Output of Phase 1

By end of Week 3, you should be able to:

* Explain **Java internals confidently**
* Handle **concurrency questions with examples**
* Think like:

  > “What happens inside JVM?” (this is senior mindset)
